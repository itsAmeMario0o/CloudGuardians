---


Welcome to the next level of cloud security! In a world where your applications are spread across bare metal, virtual, and container-based workloads, keeping data secure without losing agility is a superpower. Enter Cisco Secure Workload—a hero in disguise, bringing security closer to your applications through advanced machine learning and behavior analysis. 🦸‍♂️


What Does Cisco Secure Workload Do? 🔍

Cisco Secure Workload is your fortress of solitude in the cloud, offering comprehensive protection with the following capabilities:


**Zero-Trust Model**: Implement microsegmentation policies that allow only the traffic necessary for business operations. 🛡️
**Anomaly Detection**: Use behavioral baselining and analysis to spot suspicious activity on workloads. 👀
**Vulnerability Detection**: Identify and manage Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in software packages. 🔧
**Quarantine Recommendations**: Suggest isolating servers if vulnerabilities are found after policy enforcement. 🚨

AWS Connector: Bridging the Gap 🌉

Cisco Secure Workload seamlessly integrates with AWS, enhancing your cloud security with:


**Automated Inventory Ingestion**: Syncs metadata and tags from AWS VPCs to keep your resource mapping fresh and accurate. 🔄
**Flow Log Ingestion**: Leverage VPC flow logs for insightful telemetry and policy generation. 📊
**Segmentation Magic**: Program security policies using AWS native Security Groups for robust segmentation. 🔗
**EKS Metadata Gathering**: Gather all node, service, and pod metadata from your EKS clusters for comprehensive oversight. 🚀

How to Get Started 🏁

Integrating Cisco Secure Workload into your environment is like equipping your infrastructure with an impenetrable shield. Here's how you begin:
